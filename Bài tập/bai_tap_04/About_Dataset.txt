About Dataset
Context
Stellar Classification uses the spectral data of stars to categorize them into different categories. The modern stellar classification system is known as the Morgan–Keenan (MK) classification system. It uses the old HR classification system to categorize stars with their chromaticity and uses Roman numerals to categorize the star’s size.
In this Dataset, we will be using Absolute Magnitude and B-V Color Index to Identify Giants and Dwarfs.
